- basic skeleton of html tags and these are just standard tags that every HTML file is gonna have and they're basically going to give our browser different information about what's in our file.

HTML is a language that used to define layouts for web pages and we can define those layouts using thing called <code>
tags </code> so I can create series of tags and those tags will basically tell our web browser how we want our website to look and what content we want to have.<br>

- The <code>\<!DOCTYPE html></code>  declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document <br>
- The <code>\<html></code> element is the root element of an HTML page <br>
- The <code>\<head></code> element contains meta information about the HTML page <br>
- The <code>\<title></code> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the -browser's title bar or in the page's tab) <br>
- The <code>\<body></code> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.<br>
- The <code>\<h1> </code>element defines a large heading <br>
- The <code>\<p> </code>element defines a paragraph <br>
